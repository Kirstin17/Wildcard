Pixel Art Generator

The project was created for individuals to use their creativity to create fun or useful images using pixels. I wanted to create something visual with an artistic attribute that will draw users attention.

Installing
Step 1: Copy the Repository
Step 2: Git clone the repository onto your command line
Step 3: CD into your repository

Step 5: You can either open the file from the editor or copy and paste the path of the file into the browser.
Step 6: Browser should be displayed and ready for execution.

Getting Started
1. Once you have the file open on the browser you'll be able to create your pixel art.
2. Using the "Choose Grid Size" application you can adjust the grid to you preferred needs.
3. By selecting the box under "Pick a Color" you'll be able to select any color you prefer from the color chart.
